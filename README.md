aylin's simple, personal website 
This is a simple website I made with my little knowledge from GWC. It has facts about me and some of my likes and dislikes, it also has a part where it says where you can contact me from. All you have to do is click the buttons below the header to  reveal more information about me. I might make a second version of it once I'm more experienced with coding. Thanks for reading :3
