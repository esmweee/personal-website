    <img src="assets/myMelody3.gif" alt = "My Melody" width="200">
    <p>I don't really dislike a lot of stuff unless it's CLEARLY something bad or just weird in general..<br> I do dislike loud people and dirty/messy spaces since they make me unable to concentrate and just make my mood bad overall ( ;¬¥ - `;) </p>

    <h2>Other stuff</h2>
    <p> This section is just for more random facts about me <br> and more of my interests and goals, feel free to read if you want! <br> ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br> I've always been interested in compsci (especially game development) so I decided to <br> join a few programs too see if it was really for me (spoiler alert: it isn't LOL.) <br> However, I do find it really intriguing and amazing when I do understand what I'm doing. <br> I'm now wanting to pursue Law (don't rlly know what field yet) or might pursue something psychology related <br> I love video games so much, like a lot. Top 10 things ever created. I also love Ao3, top 10 creations oat. <br> I hate math a lot, I'm like really bad at it. <br> I'm scared of onions so that automatically makes me hate all vegetables srry vegetable lovers.</p>
